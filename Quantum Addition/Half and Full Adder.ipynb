      "source": "A quantum computer accepts input states that are coherent superpositions and subsequently manipulates these into corresponding superposition output states through a computation process. Quantum computation is a sequence of unitary transformations that form parallel data processing [1]. This allows quantum computers to efficiently solve problems which are intractable to classical computers. The quantum theory of computation reveals the fundamental connections between the laws of physics and the nature of mathematics [2,3].\n\nUnitary operations are reversible therefore quantum arithmetic is built using reversible logical components [2]. Evidently, reversible quantum networks require additional storage for intermediate results. There is a delicate balance between number of computational steps and amount of auxilliary memory used in the implementation of quantum arithmetic.\n\nIt is often possible and even desirable to perform certain parts of quantum computations using classical conventional methods. This simplifies information storage and the information retrieval process. Thus leading to a practical distinction between quantum and classical variables and their appropriate usage and limitations [3].\n\nThis lab exercise attemps a demonstration of quantum arithmetic by constructing a quantum network (qu-net). The qu-net should demonstrate the optimal use of auxiliary memory by applying a computational reversal process to optimise space usage. The network is validated against the conventional method of arithmetic using truth tables. The space complexity of the network is discussed.",

Quantum arithmetic has several implementation methods. Elementary quantum gates are used as building components. The unitary evolution operation can be formally expressed as\n\n$$ U_f |x\\rangle \\rightarrow |f(x)\\rangle$$\n\nwhere $ U_f$ is the unitary operator.\n\nThe addition of registers $|a\\rangle$ and $|b\\rangle)$ can be expressed as\n\n$$|a,b,0\\rangle \\rightarrow|a,b,a+b\\rangle$$\n\nThis expression demonstrates a naive approach using a anchilla bit ($|0\\rangle$) to store the intermediate results [5]. A better approach is an operation, expressed as\n\n$$|a,b,\\rangle \\rightarrow|a,a+b\\rangle$$\n\nwhich overwrites the result into one of the input registers [6]. The input $(a,b)$ can be obtained or reconstructed by reverse operating on the output without loss of information [3,6]. The rewritten register as well as the ouput register need to be sufficiently large to prevent overflows. A temporary register is also required to hold the carry of the operation to implement a full adder. The initialization is illustrated below.\n",

Two kinds of outputs are observed depending on the input. When $a \\geqslant b$, the output produced is $(a, a-b)$ while the output $(a, 2^{n+1}+(a-b))$ is observed when $a<b$. It is observed that the most significant qubit in the second register will always be in the state $|1\\rangle$ when $a<b$. This allows for the comparison of the inputs, it can thus be deduced with certainty whether $a$ is bigger than $b$ or not by simply inspecting the overflow. This concept provides additional information about the inputs and can be used in the effecient implementation of complex digital communication. Conventional arithmetic lacks the ability to predict the input state by observing the output state.",

The qu-net is simulated using IBM Qiskit simulator, and a quantum hardware device. The simulation results obtained from the IBM Qiskit simulator and hardware are validated against the classical method. The results from the quantum device are analysed, some errors are observed as expected. The implementation requires $4n+1$ bits of which $3n$ are qubits.The size of the input is limited to $7$ qubits and $3$ qubits so as to not exceed the $32$ qubit limitation on IBM Qiskit simulator and the $15$ qubit quantum hardware respectively. The qu-net complexity and scalability is discussed and a modest linear scaling is achieved.",
